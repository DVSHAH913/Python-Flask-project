# Python Flask Project
This was my semester 3 full-stack development project, where I learned Flask from my Coursera course 'Creating your first web page with Python and Flask,' and I've uploaded the certificate to my repository. 
The project entailed a website providing stock market predictions and news(static). It included Home, Prediction, News, Learn, About Us, and Contact Us sections. 
The Home page showcased company images, Prediction offered next-day closing prices, News provided daily news via an accordion, 
Learn imparted quick tips on indicators, About Us showcased company details, and Contact Us was a modal in the navigation bar. 
App.py links the pages, handles the database, and performs predictive calculations.
I've provided CSV files with the cleaned data so you can easily upload them into your own MySQL database and run the code. 
Make sure to change the 'host', 'user', 'password' and 'database' values in databse connector.
